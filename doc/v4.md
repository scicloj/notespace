## Version 4

### Supported environments

Any Clojure environment that uses the nREPL protocol should work fine with Notespace V4.

However, so far, only the Emacs CIDER environment has been tested extensively.

If you encounter any surprises, we would love to hear about them.

### Setup

#### Leiningen
In your project, include Notespace as a dependency [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/scicloj/notespace.svg)](https://clojars.org/scicloj/notespace).

Also, add the following to your leiningen map. This will allow Notespace to listen to evaluation events in your environment through the nREPL protocol.

```clj
:repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [scicloj.notespace.v4.nrepl/middleware]}
```
