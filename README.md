# notespace

Notebook experience in your Clojure namespace

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/scicloj/notespace.svg)](https://clojars.org/scicloj/notespace)

## What is it?

This tool is an attempt to answer the following question: can we have a notebook-like experience in Clojure without leaving one's favourite editor?

See this recorded [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufyqwzn1RDs) (demonstrating Version 3).

## Status

Version 4 is actively developed and in alpha stage. If you are new to Notespace, this is the version we recommend trying out.

Version 3 and Version 2 has been used in some projects. We are not planning to develop them further, but please reach out if you need any support.

## Versions

Notespace has been evolving gradually, slowly realizing some lessons of usage in the Scicloj study groups, in individual research projects, and in documenting some of the Scicloj libraries.

* [Version 4](doc/v4.md)

* [Version 3](doc/v3.md)

* [Version 2](doc/v2.md)

## Usage

See details in the dedicated version pages linked above.

## Relation to other projects

There are several magnificent existing options for literate programming in Clojure: Marginalia, Org-Babel, Gorilla REPL, Pink Gorilla, Clojupyter, Nextjournal, Saite, Oz. Most of them are actively developed.

Creating a separate alternative would be the least desired outcome of the current project. Rather, the hope is to compose and integrate well with some of the other projects. There has been some thoughts and experiments in that direction, and it seems promising.
